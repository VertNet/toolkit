During processing, the VertNet toolkit ("migrator") transforms data from it's original fields and their content into fields, formats, and vocabularies consistent with the Darwin Core and with the purpose of facilitating discovery. In many cases, the changes made during processing reveal data that could be improved at the source. Following is a list of reports generated during processing for VertNet showing how to interpret their contents. The square brackets indicate that the name of the data set to which the report applies, such as "Birds", "Fish", "Fossils", "Herps", "Mammals", or "Verts".

Report - [Collection] - Day out of Range.csv
  This reports contains a list of records for which the day field is less than 1 or greater than the number of days in the given month. The columns in this report are:
    catalogNumber Field - the catalogNumber for the record.
	day - the value of the day field that is outside the valid range.
	
Report - [Collection] - duplicate catalogNumber.csv
  This reports contains a list of catalog numbers that appear more than once within a given collection. If the catalogNumber is meant to uniquely identify records within a collection of data set, then duplicates are errors and should be resolved at the source. The columns in this report are:
    catalogNumber Field - the duplicated catalogNumber.
	NumberOfDups - the number of records that have the given catalogNumber.
	
Report - [Collection] - IndeterminateGeography.csv
  This report contains a list of records for which the verbatim original contents of the geography result in an ambiguity that cannot be resolved with the information in the geographic fields alone. During data processing, VertNet attempts to provide standardized geography using the Darwin Core geographic terms (continent, country, stateProvince, county, municipality, island, islandGroup, waterBody) based on the originally provided higher geographic data - fields less specific than the locality field (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#locality). If the original geography could be interpreted as more than one distinct region, or if the original geography is self-inconsistent, the record will appear in the report. The columns in this report are:
    catalogNumber - the catalogNumber identifying the record having indeterminate geography.
    verbatimMunicipality - the contents of the original data that were mapped to the Darwin Core municipality field for the given catalogNumber.
    verbatimCounty - the contents of the original data that were mapped to the Darwin Core county field for the given catalogNumber.
    verbatimStateProvince - the contents of the original data that were mapped to the Darwin Core stateProvince field for the given catalogNumber.
    verbatimCountry - the contents of the original data that were mapped to the Darwin Core country field for the given catalogNumber.
    verbatimContinent - the contents of the original data that were mapped to the Darwin Core continent field for the given catalogNumber.
    verbatimWaterBody - the contents of the original data that were mapped to the Darwin Core waterBody field for the given catalogNumber.

Report - [Collection] - StatsCompleteness.csv
  This report contains a list of records of the statistics on completeness for the data set. Each time the data set goes through processing (through the "migrator"), the numbers of records in the data set that were populated before and after processing are recorded. The report shows these counts in distinct fields after processing and in the original for a multitude of Darwin Core fields. For example, sexafter shows the number of records for which the sex field after processing was not null, while sexorig shows the number of records for which the original value of the sex field was not null. The remaining columns in this report are:
    id - a unique sequential identifier for the statsCompleteness record. A record is generated each time a migrator is run.
	institutionCode - the value of the institutionCode for the processed data set.
	collectionCode - the value of the collectionCode for the processed data set.

	recordcount - the total number of records in the data set.

Report - [Collection] - StatsDifferences.csv
  This report contains a list of the statistics on changes that were made to standardize or complete the data set. Each time the data set goes through processing (through the "migrator"), the numbers of changes in distinct fields in the data set are recorded. The report shows these changes and the number of records that were affected. The columns in this report are:
	institutionCode - the value of the institutionCode for the processed data set.
	collectionCode - the value of the collectionCode for the processed data set.
	term - the Darwin Core term for which the value was changed during migration.

Report-LinesWithNonprintingCharacters.txt
  This report contains a list of the differences between records before and after data processing removed non-printing (e.g., tab, vertical tab, new line) characters from the content of fields in the data. The report is a result of the execution of the Unix diff command on the files before and after removing the non-printing characters. To understand the report, refer to documentation on the diff command.
